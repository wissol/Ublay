Some friday evening, half an hour after school, you arrive at your friend's home.
"Hello, Mrs Farsight. Thomas invited me over. May I come in?"
"Oh, I was about to shop at Tisco's", Thomas' mother says with a thick Danish accent. "But, it's OK, I gather, Thomas is on... in his shed, to the... north, OK? Bye"
