# In case of a mighty mess
Hi friend. If you are reading this, it means I've made a mighty mess.
The red box, the Thomas Trans-Dimensional Conveyor (TTC), I told you about last month.
Yep, the one you thought I was making all up in my mind, it must have worked.
Sortish of,
If I'm lucky I shall be in some parallel universe or an alien planet fit for human life. I might be a wee bit scared for I'm not sure I will find a way to come back. 
Any help will come in handy.
Will you come? You could tell the cops, but they'll probably think it's all a joke.
"Teenagers these days..." and all that. I suppose you must be very brave if you come for me, so no worries if you don't. I was probably too "Teenagers these days..." when I pressed that button.
Anyway, in the unlikely case you want to try and rescue me 
(You could end INSIDE A VOLCANO)
(Or worse!)
(No kidding)
# Instructions
Open that red box. Inside you should see an old keyboard plugged into a Raspberry Pi and that to a black box. Do not open the black bock! (That's the TTC and you don't want to mess with it.) Really leave it alone, except for what I say. You, me could die otherwise.
Could die. But anyway, why risk?
There's a little screen also. Type "status". If the screen says "Thomas is dead", it means that, don't go for me. It's probably mightly dangerous and I'm dead already. (That's kinda creepy). if it says "Thomas is not dead", it means I'm probably alive. 
Then you go to my room and bring my ruck. It has stuff I'll need to get us both back. Tell my mom whatever. When you are back with my ruck then go...
Screw that... I've left my ruck in the cupboard... makes more sense.
Anyway, when you have my ruck, put it on and DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING INSIDE. If you break it, we'll be mightily toasted. 
Anyway, then you type. Previous Command. Twice. And then the computer will tell you about confirm, and if you are very sure you type "Yes".
And you'll be zapped somewhere around where I am. I hope. Thing is if I haven't come back, the TTC doesn't work properly. So anything could happen.
It's up to you, really. It's only my bad for experimenting on myself.
But I couldn't resist.

Your friend
Dead, alive, or Schrondinged,
Thomas
